# video.js app
A simple video player that uses videojs and electron.

To use, clone this repo and then run `npm install`.
If you run `npm link`, you'll then have a `videojs` command in your cli to open up files that way.

`videojs-youtube` is checked directly into the repo currently because I had to modify it slightly and haven't had a chance to see whether it was fixed upstream yet or submit a patch myself.
